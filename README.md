# ByteScript

ByteScript is a scripting language that explains the schema of the data that it can take as input and output. It allows easy data manipulation and transformation using abstract syntax trees (ASTs). It can be used for artificial intelligence and web development purposes. ByteScript leverages binary assembly code with IL/LLVM transpiler interpretation to achieve high performance and portability.

## Features
- It explains the schema of the data that it can take as input and output using a grammar.
- It creates and manipulates abstract syntax trees (ASTs) from data and grammar.
- It allows data extraction and composition using prefixes and suffixes.
- It supports constants, tokens, byte values, elements, parameters, comments and end of line instructions.
- It supports different kinds of actors such as customers, developers, custodians, nodes and advertisers.
- It leverages binary assembly code with IL/LLVM transpiler interpretation.

## Why Use IL/LLVM Transpilation
IL/LLVM transpiler interpretation is a technique that takes the source code of a program written in IL (Intermediate Language) and produces an equivalent source code in LLVM IR (Low Level Virtual Machine Intermediate Representation). This allows the program to be executed by LLVM's execution engine, which can perform optimization, just-in-time compilation and interpretation. IL/LLVM transpiler interpretation can achieve high performance and portability across different platforms and architectures.

## Benefits of using IL/LLVM transpiler interpretation:
- It enables sophisticated compiler analyses and transformations to be applied across arbitrary software boundaries.
- It allows lifelong and system-wide compilation and optimization of software components.
- It improves the performance and portability of programs written in IL.
